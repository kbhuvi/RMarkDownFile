## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Question 1

## What is a basic workflow for reproducible research?
#####The three basic stages of a typical computational empirical research project are:
+ Data Gathering
+ Data Analysis
+ Results Presentation

## What are five practical tips for making research reproducible?
##### The five practical tips are
1. Document everything.
2. Everything is a (text) file.
3. All files should be human readable.
4. Explicitly tie your files together.
5. Have a plan to organize, store, and make your files available.

## Give an example of how you might implement each tip.
##### Document everything!
**Example : Documenting R session info**
The sessionInfo() command in R prints a record of all of essential information like library, version used.
```{r}
    sessionInfo()
``` 
##### Everything is a (text) file.

###### All the information including data, code, result write-up and description should be stored in simplest file format possible.Some examples include
+ csv
+ txt
+ R
+ tex

##### All files should be human readable.
###### Commenting where ever required - Sample provided below
```{r}
# A complete comment line
c(1,2,3,4,5) # A comment after R code 
``` 
##### Explicitly tie your files together.
###### It is imporatnt to link the files used for a research which helps future researches to track all the data related to the research. Tie commands are the most dynamic way to explicitly link the files together 
Example Command /Program | Language
-------------            | -------------
knitr | R
rmarkdown | R 
merge| R

##### Have a plan to organize, store, and make your files available.
###### Using services like
+ GITHUB
+ DROPBOX

###### will help researchers to organize, store & share files.

##Which one of these do you think will be the most difficult?

##### All files should be human readable. - Usually when developing a code for research & if the researcher understands what needs to be implemented , he/she might miss to write the required comments for some steps, not intentionally but due to the excitement to find the results.


#Question 2 

##### Q2A: 
Complete the following code to yield a scatterplot with x as Month and y as Temp You're going to customize your plot slightly.Use the help function to assist you if needed.Make the x label "Month" and the y label "Temperature" Finally, make the title of the plot "Temperature by Month" 
```{r}
plot(x=airquality$Month, y=airquality$Temp, xlab="Month",ylab="Temperature",main="Temperature by Month")
```

##### Q2B: 
Build a scatter plot with x as Temperature and y as Ozone Complete the following code: Make the x label "Temperature" and the y label "Ozone", Make the title of the plot "Temperature vs Ozone"
```{r}
plot(x=airquality$Temp, y=airquality$Ozone, xlab="Temperature",ylab="Ozone",main="Temperature vs Ozone")
```

##### 3A, complete the following scatter plot. 
The x axis is pressure, while the y axis is temperature
Please title the graph "Temperature vs Pressure"

```{r pressure_plot, echo=TRUE}
plot(x=pressure$pressure,y=pressure$temperature,xlab="Pressure",ylab="Temperature",main="Temperature vs Pressure" )
```


##### 3B, complete the following scatter plot:
x axis is pressure, y axis is temperature,
Label the x axis as "Pressure" and the y axis as "Temperature", 
Title the graph as "Pressure vs Temperature"

```{r pressure_plot2, echo=TRUE}
plot(x=pressure$temperature,y=pressure$pressure,ylab="pressure",xlab="temperature",main="Pressure vs Temperature" )
```
